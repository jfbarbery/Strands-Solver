# Strands-Solver
A passion project that is the attempt at creating an automatic puzzle solver for the New York Times game "Strands"!

I am using an english dictionary from another repo, so all credit to the source of my words goes to these people! (who I think got their words from someone else as well lol)
Here's the link to their repository: github.com/lorenbrichter/Words
